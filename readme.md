This repo is a collection of python scripts used for playing games. It includes the following:

- Zombie Apocolypse : A simple game using breadth-first search to calculate the optimal move for tokens in a grid.

- Monte Carlo Tic Tac Toe : Uses a monte carlo method to probabilistically determine the best move for a computer tic tac toe player.

-Minimax Tic Tac Toe : Uses a recursive minimax algorithm to determine the best move for a computer tic tac toe player. Runs a bit slow, but very effective. Ideally would like to apply this to other games.  



The scripts are optimized to run in http://www.codeskulptor.org/# a web-based python environment developed by the Computer Science faculty at Rice University.
